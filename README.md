## 🎯 Why Ozark Casino Exists
The online casino space is crowded with high-burn, opaque operations that treat investor capital as fuel, not as a constrained resource. Ozark Casino is built from the opposite direction: every promotion, payout, and bonus is modeled against a hard ceiling before a single coin is given away.

The engine is a **sweepstakes model**—players receive free coins, can optionally acquire more through compliant mechanisms, and can redeem winnings via instant, fraud-aware payout rails.

## ⚙️ The Model & Risk Architecture
No promotion launches without a **worst-case table**. For each campaign, we model:

* **Free coin outflow:** Maximum coins that can be granted.
* **Conversion bands:** Conservative, base, and aggressive assumptions.
* **Payout ceilings:** Maximum daily and weekly cash exposure.
* **Bonus throttles:** Automatic tightening if metrics drift.

### Risk Snapshot
| Scenario | Investor Capital | Modeled Outcome |

| Worst-case | $50,000 | -$17,500 (35% drawdown) |
| Base case | $50,000 | +$22,500 (45% return) |
| Fast-learning | $50,000 | +$40,000 (80% return) |

## 📈 Growth Engine: Influencer-Driven
We grow through a curated roster of creators using three core pillars:

1.  **Transparent Rev-Share:** Creators see exactly how their traffic performs (deposits, redemptions, retention).
2.  **Instant Payout Hooks:** “Win on stream, cash out in under a minute” is a powerful conversion story.
3.  **Compounding Cohorts:** Each audience has its own risk profile, allowing precise tuning.

---

## 🛠️ Operational Discipline
Built around a written operating manual, not vibes. 
* **Checklists:** Daily and weekly tasks for payouts and fraud review.
* **Alert Thresholds:** Automatic flags for payout spikes or conversion anomalies.
* **Audit Trails:** Every manual override is logged.
* **Payout Stack:** Routed through bulk gift cards and cash apps with daily outflow caps per rail.

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

| **Payout Volatility** | Ceilings and dynamic throttles prevent outlier days from wrecking the month. |
